        <p>I worked in a team of three to take on the challenge of coding a marketplace website in only five days. The innovative product that my team and I created is a platform for both employers looking to hire and students looking to apply for internships. With TaskIt, employers of startups and small companies can post their company's internship in order to hire someone on a short-term basis of just a few weeks. Students who crave experience in a new field can create a profile similar to LinkedIn, browse internships, and apply easily by sending their application straight to the employer's inbox.</p>
